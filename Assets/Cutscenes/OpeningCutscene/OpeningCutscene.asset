  dialogue:
  - 'Uldren: I can''t wait to graduate and start showing off my fire magic skills.
    I''ll be the best fire magician in the land, no doubt about it.'
  - "Egron: Uldren, don't get ahead of yourself. We\u2019ve still got a long journey
    ahead of us until we reach that point. Plus, you actually have to revise to be
    able to graduate."
  - 'Uldren: Oh, come on, Egron. You know I''m the best. And once I graduate, there
    will be no stopping me. I''ll take on any challenge that comes my way.'
  - 'Egron: I hope you''re right, Uldren. But I''m not sure I''m ready for the big
    leagues. I''m still trying to figure out my place in the magical world.'
  - 'Uldren: Don''t sell yourself short, Egron. You have a lot of potential. Just
    believe in yourself and you can achieve anything you set your mind to.'
  - "Egron: Let\u2019s hope you\u2019re right."
  - "Uldren: Don\u2019t worry, I always am. I can't have my best friend holding me
    back. We have to conquer the magical world together."
  - "Egron: As long as you don\u2019t get yourself killed first."
  - 'Uldren: What are you-'
  - "Uldren: \u2026Did you hear that?"
  - "Egron: Yeah\u2026 What was that\u2026"
  - 'Uldren: Sounded like a-'
  - "Uldren: Hang on Egron, I\u2019ll save you-"
  - "Uldren: No matter what it takes\u2026"
